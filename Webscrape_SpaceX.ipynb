The static fire test, held on 24 January 2018, was the first time 27 engines were tested together. The launch was a success, and the side boosters landed simultaneously at adjacent ground pads. Drone ship landing of the central core failed due to TEA‚ÄìTEB chemical igniter running out, preventing two of its engines from restarting; the landing failure caused damage to the nearby drone ship. Final burn to heliocentric Mars‚ÄìEarth orbit was performed after the second stage and payload cruised for 6 hours through the Van Allen belts. Later, Elon Musk tweeted that the third burn was successful, and JPL's HORIZONS system showed the second stage and payload in an orbit with an aphelion of 1.67 AU. The live webcast proved immensely popular, as it became the second most watched livestream so far on YouTube, reaching over 2.3 million concurrent views. Over 100,000 visitors are believed to have come to the Space Coast to watch the launch in person.(more details below)\n",

      "USAF Space Test Program Flight 2 (STP-2) carried 24 small satellites, including: FormoSat-7 A/B/C/D/E/F integrated using EELV Secondary Payload Adapter, DSX, Prox-1 GPIM, DSAC, ISAT, SET, COSMIC-2, Oculus-ASR, OBT, NPSat, and several CubeSats including E-TBEx, LightSail 2, TEPCE, PSAT, and three ELaNa 15 CubeSats. Total payload mass was 3,700 kg. The mission lasted six hours during which the second stage ignited four times and went into different orbits to deploy satellites including a \"propulsive passivation maneuver\".Third flight of Falcon Heavy. The side boosters from the Arabsat-6A mission just 2.5 months before were reused on this flight and successfully returned to LZ-1 and LZ-2. The center core, in use for the first time, underwent the most energetic reentry attempted by SpaceX, and attempted a landing over 1,200 km (750 mi) downrange, 30% further than any previous landing. This core suffered a thrust vector control failure in the center engine caused by a breach in the engine bay due to the extreme heat. The core thus failed its landing attempt on the drone ship Of Course I Still Love You due to lack of control when the outer engines shut down. For the first time one fairing half was successfully landed on the catch-net of the support ship GO Ms. Tree (formerly Mr. Steven).\n",

The satellite is expected to be launched by a Cygnus dispenser later in July 2019.The booster used on this flight was the same used on CRS-17 earlier in the year; originally, it was planned to reuse it again for the CRS-19 mission later this year, but the plan was scrapped. For the first time, the twice flown Dragon spacecraft also made a third flight. Also used for the first time was a gray-band painted where the RP-1 kerosene tank is located, to help with thermal conductivity and thus saving fuel during long coasts.\n",

The satellite will deliver the highest power density of any commercial satellite on-orbit, generate more than 20 kW of power, and have a large unfoldable antenna reflector, which enables broadcast to radios without the need for large dish-type antennas on the ground. Due to the heavy weight, the payload was injected into a sub-synchronous orbit of 224 X 19,411 km and the satellite itself will transfer to full GTO.
